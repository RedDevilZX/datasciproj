# Cardiovascular Disease Predicition Project

## Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model for patient classification based on various features including demographics, clinical biomarkers, and medical history. The model utilizes a RandomForestClassifier for classification and employs various preprocessing techniques for data cleaning and feature engineering.

## Project Structure
The project structure is as follows:
- **Data**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Models**: Saved trained models for future use.
- **Visualizations**: Visualizations generated during the analysis.
- **README.md**: Provides an overview of the project, its structure, and instructions for running the code.

## Installation
To run the code, ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/patient-classification-project.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd patient-classification-project
```
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `Notebooks` directory to execute different parts of the project.

## Results
The project achieves an accuracy of X% on the test dataset, with detailed evaluation metrics provided in the notebook. Feature importance analysis reveals that certain demographic and clinical biomarkers significantly influence patient classification.
